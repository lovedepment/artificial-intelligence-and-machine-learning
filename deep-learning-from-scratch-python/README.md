# Deep Learning from Scratch in Python
In this project we take a deep dive into deep learning by coding from scratch all the building blocks of deep neural nets!
I am sporadically coding more components in, so far here are what we managed to build:
- Batch Gradient Descent
- Stochastic Gradient Descent
- Mini-Batch Gradient Descent
- Perceptron
- Multi-layer-perceptron (with forward and backward pass)


## Structure
We have the following files that can be used:
- `actionvation.py` which holds quite a few activation function that can be used to build a network.
- `optimizer.py` which holds the optimizers class which can be used to optimize a network.

## Notes
- For docstring we are using [Google](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md#38-comments-and-docstrings) format
