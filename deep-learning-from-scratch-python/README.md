# Deep Learning from Scratch in Python
In this project we take a deep dive into deep learning by coding from scratch all the building blocks of deep neural nets!
I am sporadically coding more components in, so far here are what we managed to build:
- Batch Gradient Descent
- Stochastic Gradient Descent
- Mini-Batch Gradient Descent
- Perceptron
- Multi-layer-perceptron (with forward and backward pass)
